React JS

	ES6 :- ECMAScript(European Compouter Manufacturers Association ) current have ES10 version - 2019
	React use ES6.
	
	Learning topics in ES6:
		Classes
		Arrow Functions
		Variables (let, const, var)


		var =  is function scope not block scope
		let = is block scope
		const = is block scope and value never changed.

	React basic html view by RENDER
	render function work if there called it by ReactDOM.render().
	this function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.

	React with JSX
	JSX stands for javascript XML
	JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
	JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
	With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces { }.
	
		eg.
			const myelement = <h1>React is {5 + 5} times better with JSX</h1>;
			ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));

	JSX will throw an error if the HTML is not properly closed.

	REACT COMPONENTS :-	
		Components come in two types, Class components and Function components
		When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.
		
		1)CLASS COMPONENT
		The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.
			class Car extends React.Component {
 			 render() {
			    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
			  }
			}
			ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('root'));
		
		The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.	

		2)FUNCTION COMPONENT
		
		except in React, components must start with an upper case letter
		function Car() {
  			return <h2>Hi, I am also a Car!</h2>;
		}
		ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('root'));

Points:
		
	variable : var,const,let
	render()
	component -> component to component -> other files getting component to app.js file
	constructor -> properties -> arrow function() -> state & props
	reactlifecycle : The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
	react event -> bind this method
	react form -> submit and sent to user functionality -> with react validation
	react css file how to work with that -> module wise css

Extra data learn : ajax -> api ->  curl process.
